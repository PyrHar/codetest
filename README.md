# CodeTest: Python Library Application

This is a simple Python library application where you can store your favorite books and check them out later if you’ve forgotten what you’ve read!

## How It Works

This lightweight application only needs a single command to start:

```bash
python library.py library.txt

When starting the program you get 3 diffrent prompts:

1) Add Book, when pressed you are getting more prompts to add the name of the book, author, ISBN and publishing year of the book
2) Show Library, when pressed the program will print out all books that are currently stored inside the file
Q) Quit, simply shuts down the program and gives you farewell

When adding books to the database it overwrites the existing file so it can manage quick execution times when making sure that the books are in right order
