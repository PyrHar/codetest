# CodeTest: Python Library Application

This is a simple Python library application where you can store your favorite books and check them out later if you’ve forgotten what you’ve read!

## How It Works

This lightweight application only needs a single command to start:

```bash
python library.py library.txt


When Starting the Program, You Get 3 Different Prompts:

Add Book:
Gives you possibility to add the name of the book, author, ISBN, and publishing year.

Show Library:
Displays all books currently stored inside the library.txt file.

Quit (Q):
Simply shuts down the program and gives you a farewell message.
